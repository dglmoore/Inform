= Empirical Distributions

The link:index.html#inform_dist[`inform_dist`] struct provides an _empirical_ distribution,
i.e. a histogram, representing the observed frequencies of some fixed-sized set of events.
This structure is the basis for all of the fundamental information measures provided on
discrete probability distributions.

The purpose of the link:index.html#inform_dist[`inform_dist`] is to make writing custom
implementations of information-theoretic measures possible. Most of the measures implemented
in *Inform* use this structure at their core.

typedef struct inform_distribution
{
    /// the histogram or array of observation frequencies
    uint32_t *histogram;

} inform_dist;
----
A distribution of observed event frequencies

This structure is the basis for almost all of the calculations performed via the library. It
provides a means of managing observations and converting the observed event frequencies to
probabilities.

A distribution can be allocated with a set number of observable events
(<<inform_dist_alloc,inform_dist_alloc>>), resized
(<<inform_dist_realloc,inform_dist_realloc>>), copied
(<<inform_dist_copy,inform_dist_copy>>) or duplicated (<<inform_dist_dup,inform_dist_dup>>).
Once the distribution has served its purpose, it can be free'd
(<<inform_dist_free,inform_dist_free>>).

The distribution is, roughly, a histogram with finite support. The events are assumed to be
mapped to the dense set of integers stem:[\{0,1,\ldots,N-1\}] where stem:[N] is the number
of observable events. The number of observable events can be extracted with
<<inform_dist_size,inform_dist_size>>.

Events can be observed one at a time (<<inform_dist_tick,inform_dist_tick>>) or in batches
(<<inform_dist_set,inform_dist_set>>). The occurrence frequency of a given event can be
obtained (<<inform_dist_get,inform_dist_get>>) as can the total number of observations
(<<inform_dist_counts,inform_dist_counts>>).

Once the distribution populated, the probabilities can be extracted in either
element-by-element (<<inform_dist_prob,inform_dist_prob>>) or dumped to a dynamically
allocated array (<<inform_dist_dump,inform_dist_dump>>).

Whenever the size of the support or the number of observed events is zero, the distribution
is considered invalid meaning that you can't trust any probabilities extracted from it. One
can use <<inform_dist_is_valid,inform_dist_is_valid>> to assess the validity of the
distribution.

[[dist-allocation]]
== Allocation
****
[[inform_dist_alloc]]
[source,c]
----
inform_dist* inform_dist_alloc(size_t n);
----
Allocate a distribution with a specified support size.

The allocation will fail and return `NULL` if either `n == 0` or the memory allocation fails
for whatever reason.

Immediately following allocation, the distribution is invalid.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_alloc(0);
assert(dist == NULL);
----
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_alloc(2);
assert(dist != NULL);
assert(dist->size == 2);
assert(dist->counts == 0);
// dist->histogram ~ {0,0}
inform_dist_free(dist);
----
****

****
[[inform_dist_realloc]]
[source,c]
----
inform_dist* inform_dist_realloc(inform_dist *dist, size_t n);
----
Resize the distribution to have new support.

If the distribution is `NULL`, a new distribution of the requested size is allocated.

If the distribution already has the requested size, then the original distribution is
returned. If the requested size is greater than the current size, then the newly observable
events are assigned zero frequency. If the requested size is less than the current size,
then the discarded events are lost and the observation count is adjusted accordingly.

Note that the distribution cannot be reduced to size `0`. In that case the distribution is
left unmodified.

In the event that the reallocation fails, the original distribution is left untouched.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_alloc(2);
assert(dist);
// dist->histogram ~ {0,0}

inform_dist *bigger = inform_dist_realloc(dist, 5);
assert(bigger);
// bigger->histogram ~ {0,0,0,0,0}

inform_dist *smaller = inform_dist_realloc(bigger, 3);
assert(smaller != NULL);
// smaller->histogram ~ {0,0,0}

inform_dist_free(smaller);
----
****

****
[[inform_dist_copy]]
[source,c]
----
inform_dist* inform_dist_copy(inform_dist const *src,
        inform_dist *dest);
----
Copy a distribution to a destination.

If the source distribution is `NULL`, then the destination is left untouched and `NULL` is
returned.

In the event that the destination is `NULL` or has a different size from that of the source,
the destination is reallocated, and the result is returned.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *source = inform_dist_alloc(5);
assert(source);
for (int i = 0; i < (int) source->size; ++i)
    source->histogram[i] = i;
// source->histogram ~ {0,1,2,3,4};

inform_dist *target = inform_dist_alloc(5);
assert(target);

inform_dist_copy(source, target);
// target->histogram ~ {0,1,2,3,4};

inform_dist_free(target);
inform_dist_free(source);
----
****

****
[[inform_dist_dup]]
[source,c]
----
inform_dist* inform_dist_dup(inform_dist const *dist);
----
Duplicate a distribution.

This function simply duplicates a distribution, essentially allocating a new distribution
and copying the contents of the source to the new distribution.

If the allocation fails or the source distribution is `NULL`, then the return value is
`NULL`.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *source = inform_dist_alloc(5);
assert(source);
for (int i = 0; i < (int) source->size; ++i)
    source->histogram[i] = i;
// source->histogram ~ {0,1,2,3,4};

inform_dist *target = inform_dist_dup(source);
assert(target);
// target->histogram ~ {0,1,2,3,4};

inform_dist_free(target);
inform_dist_free(source);
----
****

****
[[inform_dist_create]]
[source,c]
----
inform_dist* inform_dist_create(uint32_t const *data, size_t n);
----
Create a distribution from an underlying histogram.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_create((int[5]){0,1,2,3,4}, 5);
assert(dist);
// dist->histogram ~ {0,1,2,3,4}
inform_dist_free(dist);
----
****

****
[[inform_dist_infer]]
[source,c]
----
inform_dist* inform_dist_infer(int const *events, size_t n);
----
Infer a distribution from a collection of observed events.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_infer((int[]){0,0,1,0,1}, 5);
assert(dist);
// dist->histogram ~ {3,2}
inform_dist_free(dist);
----
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_infer((int[]){0,0,1,0,1,2,2,1}, 8);
// dist->histogram ~ {3,3,2}
inform_dist_free(dist);
----
****

****
[[inform_dist_approximate]]
[source,c]
----
inform_dist* inform_dist_approximate(double const *probs, size_t n,
        double tol);
----
Approximate a given probability distribution to a given tolerance.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
double probs[3] = {0.5, 0.2, 0.3};
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_approximate(probs, 3, 1e-3);
assert(dist);
// dist->histogram ~ {5, 2, 3}
inform_dist_free(dist);
----
[source,c]
----
double probs[2] = {1./3, 2./3};
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_approximate(probs, 2, 1e-3);
assert(dist);

inform_dist_free(dist);
----
[source,c]
----
double probs[4] = {1./3, 1./3, 1./6, 1./6};
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_approximate(probs, 4, 1e-3);
assert(dist);
// dist->histogram ~ {333,333,166,166}
inform_dist_free(dist);
----
[source,c]
----
double probs[4] = {1./7, 2./7, 1./3, 10./42};
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_approximate(probs, 4, 1e-3);
assert(dist);
// dist->histogram ~ {142,285,333,238}
inform_dist_free(dist);
----
****

****
[[inform_dist_uniform]]
[source,c]
----
inform_dist* inform_dist_uniform(size_t n);
----
Create a uniform distribution of a given size.

*Examples:*

assert(dist == NULL);
----
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_uniform(3);

[[dist-access]]
== Accessors/Mutators
****
[[inform_dist_size]]
[source,c]
----
size_t inform_dist_size(inform_dist const *dist);
----
Get the size of the distribution's support.

If the distribution is `NULL`, then a support of `0` is returned.

inform_dist *dist = NULL;
assert(inform_dist_size(dist) == 0);
----
[source,c]

----
****

****
[[inform_dist_is_valid]]
[source,c]
----
bool inform_dist_is_valid(inform_dist const *dist);
----
Determine whether or not the distribution is valid.

In order to safely extract probabilities, the distribution must be non-`NULL`, the size of
the support must be non-zero and the number of observations must be non-zero. In any other
case, the distribution is invalid.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = NULL;
assert(!inform_dist_is_valid(dist));
----
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_alloc(3);

inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_uniform(5);
assert(dist);
assert(inform_dist_is_valid(dist));
inform_dist_free(dist);
----
****

****
[[inform_dist_get]]
[source,c]
----
uint32_t inform_dist_get(inform_dist const *dist, size_t event);
----
Get the number of occurrences of a given event.

If the distribution is `NULL` or the `event` is not in the support, `0` is returned.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = NULL;
assert(inform_dist_get(dist, 0) == 0);
assert(inform_dist_get(dist, 1) == 0);
assert(inform_dist_get(dist, 2) == 0);
----
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_create((int[]){3,2,1,0}, 4);
assert(dist);
assert(inform_dist_get(dist, 0) == 3);
assert(inform_dist_get(dist, 1) == 2);
assert(inform_dist_get(dist, 2) == 1);
assert(inform_dist_get(dist, 3) == 0);
inform_dist_free(dist);
----
****

****
[[inform_dist_set]]
[source,c]
----
uint32_t inform_dist_set(inform_dist *dist, size_t event, uint32_t x);
----
Set the number of occurrences of a given event.

This function manually sets the number of occurrences of a given event.  Note that the only
restriction is that the value be positive. This means that this function can be used to
invalidate the distribution by changing all of the event frequencies to zero.

If the event is not in the support or the distribution is `NULL`, then nothing happens and
zero is returned.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = NULL;
assert(inform_dist_set(dist, 0, 5) == 0);
assert(inform_dist_get(dist, 0) == 0);
----
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_alloc(2);

assert(inform_dist_set(dist, 0, 3) == 3);
assert(inform_dist_set(dist, 1, 7) == 7);

----
****

****
[[inform_dist_tick]]
[source,c]
----
uint32_t inform_dist_tick(inform_dist *dist, size_t event);
----
Increment the number of observations of a given event.

As an alternative to inform_dist_set, this function simply increments the number of
occurrences of a given event. This is useful for when iteratively observing events.

If the event is not in the support or the distribution is `NULL`, then
nothing happens and zero is returned.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = NULL;
assert(inform_dist_tick(dist, 0) == 0);
assert(inform_dist_tick(dist, 1) == 0);
----
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_create((int[]){2,4}, 2);

assert(inform_dist_tick(dist, 0) == 3);
assert(inform_dist_tick(dist, 1) == 5);

assert(inform_dist_get(dist, 0) == 3);
assert(inform_dist_get(dist, 1) == 5);

inform_dist_free(dist);

****

****
[[inform_dist_accumulate]]
[source,c]
----
size_t inform_dist_accumulate(inform_dist *dist, int const *events,
        size_t n);
----
Accumulate observations from a series.

If an invalid distribution is provided, no events will be observed (0 will be returned). If
an invalid event is provided, then the number of valid events to that point will be
returned.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
int const events[5] = {0,0,1,0,1};
assert(inform_dist_accumulate(NULL, events, 5) == 0);
----
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_create((int[]){1,2,3}, 3);
assert(dist);
assert(inform_dist_accumulate(dist, NULL, 5) == 0);
inform_dist_free(dist);
----
[source,c]
----
int const events[5] = {0,0,1,0,1};
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_create((int[]){1,2}, 2);
assert(dist);
assert(inform_dist_accumulate(dist, events, 5) == 5);
// dist->histogram ~ { 4, 4 }
inform_dist_free(dist);
----
[source,c]
----
int const events[5] = {0,1,1,3,1};
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_create((int[]){1,2}, 2);

assert(inform_dist_accumulate(dist, events, 5) == 3);
// dist->histogram ~ { 2, 4 }
inform_dist_free(dist);
----
****

[[dist-probabilities]]
== Probabilities
****
[[inform_dist_prob]]
[source,c]
----
double inform_dist_prob(inform_dist const *dist, size_t event);
----
Extract the probability of an event.

This function simply computes the probability of a given event and returns that value.

If the event is not in the support, the distribution is `NULL`, or no observations have yet
been made, then a zero probability is returned.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = NULL;
assert(inform_dist_prob(dist, 0) == 0.0);
----
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_create((int[]){2,2,4}, 3);
assert(dist);
assert(inform_dist_prob(dist, 0) == 0.25);
assert(inform_dist_prob(dist, 1) == 0.25);
assert(inform_dist_prob(dist, 2) == 0.50);
inform_dist_free(dist);
----
****

****
[[inform_dist_dump]]
[source,c]
----
size_t inform_dist_dump(inform_dist const *dist, double *probs,
        size_t n);
----
Dump the probabilities of all events to an array.

This function computes the probabilities of all of the events in the support, stores them in
the provided array, and the number of values written.

If the distribution is `NULL`, -1 is returned. If the destination is NULL, -2 is returned.
If `n` is not equal to the distribution's support, -3 is returned.

*Examples:*
[source,c]
----
double probs[3];
assert(inform_dist_dump(NULL, probs, 3) == -1);
----
[source,c]
----
inform_dist *dist = inform_dist_create((int[]){2,2,4}, 3);
