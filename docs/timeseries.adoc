[[time-series-measures]]
= Time Series Measures

The original purpose of *Inform* was to analyze time series data. This explains why most of
*Inform*'s functionality resides in functions specifically optimized for analyzing time
series. The API was designed to be easy to use in C or {cpp}, or to be wrapped in a
higher-level language, e.g. https://elife-asu.github.io/PyInform[Python]. This means that we
avoided some of the "niceties" of C, such as extensive use of macros and other generic
atrocities, in favor of wrappability. Keep this in mind as you learn the API.

Many information measures have "local" variants which compute a time series of point-wise
values. These local variants have names similar to their averaged or global counterparts,
e.g <<inform_active_info,inform_active_info>> and
<<inform_local_active_info,inform_local_active_info>>. We have been meticulous in ensuring
that function and parameter names are consistent across measures. If you notice some
inconsistency, please https://github.com/elife-asu/inform/issue[report it as an issue].

[[time-series-notation]]
== Notation

Throughout the discussion of time series measures, we will try to use a consistent notation.
We will denote random variables as stem:[X,Y,\ldots], and let stem:[x_i,y_i,\ldots]
represent the stem:[i]-th time step of a time series drawn from the associated random
variable. Many of the measures consider stem:[k]-histories (a.k.a stem:[k]-blocks) of the
time series, e.g. stem:[x_i^{(k)} = \left\{x_{i-k+1}, x_{i-k+2},\ldots,x_i\right\}].

When denoting probability distributions, we will only make the random variable explicit in
situations where the notation is ambiguous. We will typically write stem:[p(x_i)],
stem:[p(x_i^{(k)})], and stem:[p(x_i^{(k)}, x_{i+1})] to denote the empirical probability
of observing the stem:[x_i] state, the stem:[x_i^{(k)}] stem:[k]-history, and the joint
probability of observing stem:[\left(x_i^{(k)}, x_{i+1}\right)].

*Please report any notational ambiguities as an

[[time-series-detail]]
== Implementation Details

=== The Base: States and Logarithms
The word "base" has two different meanings in the context of information measures on time
series. It could refer to the base of the time series itself, that is the number of unique
states in the time series. For example, the time series stem:[\{0,2,1,0,0\}] is a base-3
time series. On the other hand, it could refer to the base of the logarithm used in
computing the information content of the inferred probability distributions. The problem is
that these two meanings clash. The base of the time series affects the range of values the
measure can produce, and the base of the logarithm represents a rescaling of those values.

In this library we deal with this by *always* using base-2 logarithms, and having the user
specify the base of the time series — don't worry, we <<error-handling, set an error>> if
the provided base doesn't make sense. All of this ensures that the library is a simple as
reasonably possible.

=== Multiple Initial Conditions
You generally need *a lot* of data to infer a probability distribution.  An experimentalist
or simulator might then collect data over multiple trials or initial conditions. Most of
*Inform*'s time series measures allow the user to pass in a two-dimensional, rectangular
array which each row representing a time series from a different initial condition. From
this the probability distributions are inferred, and the desired value is calculated. This
has the downside of requiring that the user store all of the data in memory, but it has the
advantage of being fast and simple. Trade-offs, man...

A subsequent release, https://github.com/elife-asu/inform/milestone/3[likely v1.1.0], will
allows the initial conditions to have time series of different lengths and will provide
accumulator implementations of all of these measures that will let the incrementally
construct the distributions. This will lift some of the memory burden at the expense of
runtime performance.

=== Calling Conventions
All of the of the time series functions described in this section use the same basic calling
conventions and use the same (or similar) argument names were possible.

|===
| Argument Name | Description

| `series`
| A 2-D or 3-D, finite-state time series in contiguous, row-major form

| `l`
| The number of "sources" or variables in a 3-D time series

| `n`
| The number of initial conditions per "source"

| `m`
| The number of time steps per "source"

| `b`
| The base of the time series

| `k`
| The length history length

| `err`
| An error argument
|===

Average measures generally return a double-precision, floating-point value while local
variants return a pointer to an appropriately shaped, contiguous array. Local measures
accept an argument, often named after the function (e.g. local active information takes an
`ai` argument), which is used to store the computed local values. If that argument is NULL,
then the function allocates an array.

We will try to note any deviations from these conventions.

[[active-info]]
== Active Information

Active information (AI) was introduced in <<Lizier2012>> to quantify information storage in
distributed computations. Active information is defined in terms of a temporally local
variant

[stem]
++++
a_{X,i}(k) = \log_2{\frac{p(x_i^{(k)}, x_{i+1})}{p(x_i^{(k)})p(x_{i+1})}}.
++++

where the probabilities are constructed empirically from the _entire_ time series. From the
local variant, the temporally global active information is defined as

[stem]
++++
A_X(k) = \langle a_{X,i}(k) \rangle_i
       = \sum_{x_i^{(k)},x_{i+1}} p(x_i^{(k)},x_{i+1}) \log_2{\frac{p(x_i^{(k)}, x_{i+1})}{p(x_i^{(k)})p(x_{i+1})}}.
++++

Strictly speaking, the local and average active information are defined as

[stem]
++++
a_{X,i} = \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty}a_{X,i}(k)
\qquad \textrm{and} \qquad
A_X = \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty}A_X(k),
++++

but we do not provide limiting functionality in this library
(https://github.com/elife-asu/issues/24[yet]!).

Effective information is a _causal_ measure aimed at teasing out the causal structure of a

distribution — a probability distribution over initial states — and the distribution after
one time step:
[stem]

EI(A,p) = I(p,p^TA)
++++
where stem:[A] is the transition probability matrix. Functionality to construct a transition
probability matrix from time series is provided by the <<inform_tpm>> function.

Formally, the excess entropy is the mutual information between two adjacent, semi-infinite

[[information-flow]]
== Information Flow
Information flow (IF) was introduced by Ay and Polani as a measure of the "strength of a
causal effect" (<<Ay2008>>). Unlike many of the other measures in *Inform*, information flow
was designed around interventions: rather than allowing dynamics to progress naturally, some
subset of the random variables are forced into a particular state. If no interventions are
performed, then IF reduces to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_mutual_information[conditional mutual
information].

Practially, there is no way for *Inform* to know from time series whether or not any
interventions have actually been performed upon the system. As such, the onous is on the
user to determine whether this function is in-fact computing Ay and Polani's information
flow.

In accordance with <<Ay2008>>, information flow is defined as

[stem]
++++
I_p(X \rightarrow Y | Z) = \sum_{x,y,z} p(z)p(x|\hat{z})p(y|\hat{x},\hat{z})
    \log{
        \frac{p(y|\hat{x},\hat{z})}
        {\sum_{x^\prime} p(x^\prime|\hat{z})p(y|\hat{x}^\prime,\hat{z})}
    }
++++

All probabilities are estimated from sequences of observations — the order of those
sequences is irrelevant. A https://github.com/elife-asu/inform/issues/76[subsequent version]
will allow the user to specify intervention distributions.

double inform_information_flow(int const *src, int const *dst,
        int const *back, size_t l_src, size_t l_dst, size_t l_back,
        size_t n, size_t m, int b, inform_error *err);
----

*Examples:*
This example demonstrates how to user `inform_information_flow` to analyzed Ay and Polani's
diamond structure example (<<Ay2008>> p.28-29). In this example, we have four interacting
Boolean variables stem:[W], stem:[X], stem:[Y] and stem:[Z]. The variables stem:[X] and
stem:[Y] are each dependent on stem:[W]: they simply copy it's state. The stem:[Z] variable
is the XOR of the states of stem:[X] and stem:[Y]. The variable stem:[W] is uniformly
distributed.

_Example 1_: Natural dynamics

Left to it's own devices, this system might produce a sequence of observations like:
[source,c]
----
int const ws[8] = {0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1};
int const xs[8] = {0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1};
int const ys[8] = {0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1};
int const zs[8] = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};
----
From these we can compute the following information flows:
[stem]
++++
I_p(X \rightarrow Y) = 1 \\
I_p(X \rightarrow Y | W) = 0 \\
I_p(W \rightarrow Z | Y) = 0.
++++
Our notation departs somewhat from that of <<Ay2008>> as we denote these as information
flows despite the fact that we are not strictly intervening upon the system. If the user
prefers, they can think of this as "intervening on the system that is indistiguishable from
the natural dynamics". In any case, we can use `inform_information_flow` to compute the the
above values
[source,c]
----
inform_error err = INFORM_SUCCESS;
double flow = 0.0;
flow = inform_information_flow(xs, ys, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8, 2, &err);
assert(!err);
// flow ~ 1.0
flow = inform_information_flow(xs, ys, ws, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 2, &err);
assert(!err);
// flow ~ 0.0
flow = inform_information_flow(ws, zs, ys, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 2, &err);
assert(!err);
// flow ~ 0.0
----

_Example 2_: Interventions

Now, consider that we can intervene on stem:[Y] and force it to whichever state we so
choose. Then we might end up with a sequence of observations as
[source,c]
----
int const ws[8] = {0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1};
int const xs[8] = {0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1};
int const ys[8] = {1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0};
int const zs[8] = {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};
----
From these we can compute the following information flows:
[stem]
++++
I_p(X \rightarrow Y) = 0 \\
I_p(X \rightarrow Y | W) = 0 \\
I_p(W \rightarrow Z | Y) = 1.
++++

In *Inform* this looks like:
[source,c]
----
inform_error err = INFORM_SUCCESS;
double flow = 0.0;
flow = inform_information_flow(xs, ys, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 1, 8, 2, &err);
assert(!err);
// flow ~ 0.0
flow = inform_information_flow(xs, ys, ws, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 2, &err);
assert(!err);
// flow ~ 0.0
flow = inform_information_flow(ws, zs, ys, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 2, &err);
assert(!err);
// flow ~ 1.0

[[mutual-information]]
== Mutual Information
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information[Mutual information] (MI) is a measure of
the amount of mutual dependence between at least two random variables. Locally, MI is
defined as
[stem]
++++
i_i(X_1,\ldots,X_l) = \frac{p(x_{1,i},\ldots,x_{l,i})}{p(x_{1,i})\ldots p(x_{l,i})}.
++++
The mutual information is then just the time average of stem:[i_i(X_1,\ldots,X_l)]:
[stem]
++++
I(X_1,\ldots,X_l) =
    \sum_{x_{1,i},\ldots,x_{l,i}} p(x_{1,i},\ldots,x_{l,i}) \frac{p(x_{1,i},\ldots,x_{l,i})}{p(x_{1,i})\ldots p(x_{l,i})}.

[[predictive-information]]
== Predictive Information
Formally, the predictive information is the mutual information between a finite-history and
a semi-infinite future:

P_X(k) = \lim_{l \rightarrow \infty}I[(x_{-k},\ldots,x_{-1}),(x_0,\ldots,x_{l-1})].
++++
Of course, we cannot take the limit in practice, so we implement the finite form:
[stem]
++++
P_X(k,l) = I[(x_{-k},\ldots,x_1),(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1})].
++++

We can think of <<active-info, active information>> and <<excess-entropy, excess entropy>>

[[separable-information]]
== Separable Information

Separable information (SI) was introduced in <<Lizier2010>> as a method for detecting
information modification in distributed computations. Given a random variable stem:[Y]
and a collection of potentially informative sources stem:[V_Y] (wherein stem:[Y \not\in
V_Y]), separable information quantifies the total information gained about stem:[Y] from
seperate observations of histories of stem:[Y] and "transfer contributions" from each of the
sources stem:[X \in V_Y]. In other words, it is the sum of the <<active-info>> of
stem:[Y] and the (apparent) <<transfer-entropy>> from each source to stem:[Y]:

[stem]
++++
s_{Y,i}(k) = a_{Y,i}(k) + \sum_{X \in V_Y} t_{X \rightarrow Y, i}(k),\\
S_Y(k) = \langle s_{Y,i}(k) \rangle_i = A_Y(k) + \sum_{X \in V_Y} T_{X \rightarrow Y}(k).

[[transfer-entropy]]
== Transfer Entropy

Transer entropy (TE) was introduced in <<Schreiber2000>> to quantify information transfer
between an information source and destination, conditioning out shared history effects. TE
was originally formulated considering only the source and destination; however many systems
of interest have more just those two components. As such, it may be further necessary to
condition the probabilities on the states of all "background" components in the system.
These two forms are sometimes referred to as _apparent_ and _complete_ transfer entropy,
respectively (<<Lizier2008>>).

Our implementation of TE allows the user to condition the probabilities on any number of
background processes, within hardware limits. For the subsequent description, take stem:[X]
to be the source, stem:[Y] the target, and stem:[\mathcal{W} = \left\{W_1, \ldots,
W_l\right\}] be the background processes against which we'd like to condition. For example,
we might take the state of two nodes in a dynamical network as the source and target, while
all other nodes in the network are treated as the background. Transfer entropy is then
defined in terms of a time-local variant

[stem]
++++
t_{X \rightarrow Y, \mathcal{W}, i}(k) =
    \log_2{\frac{p(y_{i+1},x_i|y^{(k)}_i,W_i)}
    {p(y_{i+1}|y^{(k)}_i,W_i)p(x_{i+1}|y^{(k)}_i,W_i)}}
++++

where stem:[W_i = w_{1,i},\ldots,w_{l,i}] are the states of each of the background nodes at
time step stem:[i], and the probabilities are constructed empirically from the _entire_ time
series. From the local variant, the temporally global transfer entropy is defined as

[stem]
++++
T_{X \rightarrow Y, \mathcal{W}}(k)
    = \langle t_{X \rightarrow Y, \mathcal{W}, i}(k) \rangle_i
    = \sum_{y_{i+1},y^{(k)},x_i,W_i} p(y_{i+1},y^{(k)}_i,x_i,W_i)
    \log_2{\frac{p(y_{i+1},x_i|y^{(k)}_i,W_i)}
    {p(y_{i+1}|y^{(k)}_i,W_i)p(x_{i+1}|y^{(k)}_i,W_i)}}.
++++

Strictly speaking, the local and average transfer entropy are defined as

[stem]
++++
t_{X \rightarrow Y, \mathcal{W}, i}
    = \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} t_{X \rightarrow Y, \mathcal{W}, i}(k)
\qquad \textrm{and} \qquad
T_{X \rightarrow Y, \mathcal{W}}
    = \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} t_{X \rightarrow Y, \mathcal{W}}(k),
++++

but we do not provide limiting functionality in this library
(https://github.com/elife-asu/issues/24[yet]!).

This example is interesting in that the two background process provide the same information
about the target as the source process does, but they don't separately.
